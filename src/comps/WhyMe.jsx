          As a Software Engineer Intern with the Government of Ontario, I
          rewrote Python/Selenium automation scripts to run 2.3× faster and
          built an ETL tool to feed GitLab and Oracle data into Azure for daily
          Power BI dashboards.

          At Bridgesystems.net, I designed and deployed a secure MERN-stack
          platform—integrating AWS S3 image uploads, JWT-based sessions, and
          CI/CD pipelines—to deliver scalable, resilient web apps.

        <p className="WhyMe-text">
          I’ve also led secure-coding workshops for 200+ students at Code Ninjas
          and organized a hackathon, because mentoring helps me deepen my own
          skills and understanding.

          My goal is to build and secure web applications that empower users
          without ever compromising performance or data integrity. In the future
          I hope to land a full-time role that handles with both security and
          big data.
